		<h1>THE BASICS OF CODING FOR WEB DESIGN</h1>
		<p>
			Browser uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display or retrieve functional
			and interactive information to the user. When you open a web page, your
			browser fetches the HTML and other programming languages involved and
			interprets it.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages; they're
			just page structure and style information. But before moving on to
			JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know the basics of HTML
			and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web page and application.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only language available on the web.
			Web developers had to painstakingly code static sites, page by page.
