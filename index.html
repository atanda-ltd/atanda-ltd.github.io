		<h1>THE BASICS OF CODING FOR WEB DESIGN</h1>
		<p>
			The browser uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display or retrieve users'
			useful information. When you open a web page, your browser fetches the
			HTML and other programming languages involved and interprets it.
		</p>
		<p>
			User-agent uses HTML to structure the contents (text, images and videos).
			CSS to style the look and feel of the materials and uses JavaScript to add
			functionality (like form validation). Typically, HTML and CSS are not
			technically programming languages. They're just page structure to style
			information (while Javascript handles various functionalities as a
			programming language).
		</p>
		<p>
			In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only interface available on the web.
			Web developers had to code static sites, page by page painstakingly.
