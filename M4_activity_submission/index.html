			<h2>Rationale 1</h2>
			<p>
				I chose to optimise the image on this section to improves page load
				speed. The optimisation will enable the user agent to render the figure
				to the user swiftly and with lesser data consumption (Since users love
				the websites having less than 2 load speed).
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, this image was optimised to improve SEO ranking. Since 2010,
				optimisation became crucial to the web, because it became a major
				ranking factor for the search engine. Google hardly recommend slow
				websites to users. Marketing Leaders such as Moz and SemRush have also
				published their insights about it.
			</p>

			<h2>Rationale 2</h2>
			<p>
				The primary goal of formatting images is to find the balance between the
				smallest file size and acceptable quality. These are my tactics to
				troubleshoot issues with image optimisation;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose the right format (PNG, JPG, SVG and GIF)</li>
				<li>
					Compress quality vs size (use higher compression rate for smaller
					images and low compression rate for larger images)
				</li>
				<li>
					Usage of Lossy and Lossless (know when to compress data or remove data
					from images)
				</li>
				<li>
					Resizing images to scale (create several sizes to respond to various
					screen sizes)
				</li>
			</ul>
